abstract = {Process water from mineral processing plants may contain a significant amount of dissolved metal ions, which may be recycled as process water, or discharged into the environment as effluent. If they are discharged into the environment they may cause significant problems for the local flora and fauna. One method of removing metal ions from aqueous systems, which has generated considerable interest over recent years, is the emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) technique, which incorporates solvent extraction and stripping. This work details the use of design of experiments applied to an ELM process for removing copper ions from a dilute aqueous solution. Initially, a fractional factorial design was used to screen out the most important factors; this was followed by a central composite design to obtain optimal operating conditions. The extraction percentage of copper was obtained as more than 99% under these conditions.}

abstract = {This study investigates extraction of nickel from aqueous solution using a green emulsion liquid membrane (GELM). Waste cooking oil and Cyanex 301 showed excellent potential for extraction of nickel as diluent and extractant respectively. Process intensification was achieved through parameter screening and optimization using Plackett Barman design (PBD). Screening of the nine process parameters viz. surfactant concentration (1 - 3, v/v,%), carrier concentration (2-6, v/v,%), agitation speed (200-600, rpm), agitation time (5-15 min), pH of the feed solution (3-7), treat ratio (10-20), internal stripping agent concentration (0.25 – 0.75 M), initial Ni ion concentration (100-500 mg/L) and volume of organic to aqueous phase ratio (1-2), were conducted. Under optimal conditions, the maximum nickel that selectively transferred into the internal phase was 98.7%. The best operating optimum conditions identified were: surfactant concentration – 2.66 (v/v,%), carrier concentration – 5.2 (v/v,%), pH of the feed solution – 4.2, treat ratio – 10.0, initial Ni ion concentration – 100 mg/L. The stripping efficiency and reusability of GELM was also studied for nickel extraction. Artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to model the GELM process and the results were compared.}

In this work, the zinc plant copper cake was leached with hydrochloric acid solution and main acidic leach solution containing various ions was obtained. After various ions in the acidic leach solution were separated, optimum conditions were determined. The results showed that it is possible to extract 99% of cobalt using ELM from strong acidic leach solutions, containing cobalt and nickel ions, at the optimum conditions.}

abstract = {Emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) is highly efficient in heavy metal ion separation from wastewater. However, substantial effort is required to overcome the instability in the process. Hence, this research demonstrates the stability of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion and demulsification for zinc recovery from chloride media. Iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles were used as a solid stabilizer in the formation of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion. Several operating parameters affecting the stability of W/O/W emulsion by means of breakage/swelling and globule size diameter were studied, such as organic-to-internal phase (O/I) ratio, agitation speed, time, and treatment ratio. The most stable formulated W/O/W emulsion was used in the demulsification process using heating-ultrasonic method. The study was conducted by manipulating the temperature, frequency, and time. Meanwhile, experiments on the effect of modifier type, carrier, and stripping agent concentration were carried out for zinc recovery. The most stable W/O/W emulsion was obtained at 1.35:1O/I ratio, 300 rpm agitation speed, 3 min agitation time, and 1:5 treatment ratio. Complete demulsification was achieved at a temperature of 50 °C, 40 kHz frequency, and 210 min contact time. At the best condition of 3% (w/v) 1-octanol, 0.03 M carrier concentration (D2EHPA/Cyanex 302), and 1.375 M acidic thiourea, approximately 93.14% zinc was extracted, and 4.65 times enrichment was obtained in the recovery phase. Hence, it can be concluded that enhancing the stability of emulsion could potentially make ELM applicable in the industry.}

abstract = {Abstract The emulsion liquid membrane technique was utilized to selectively extract copper and nickel from a synthetic aqueous solution containing calcium, which was used to mimic a tailings stream found in the Sudbury region of Canada. The results showed copper and nickel ions were successively extracted from the synthetic solution. Two central composite designs and an analysis of the experiments were used to optimize the process and determine the main effects and interactions of experimental factors. In the first stage, copper was extracted with a minimum removal of nickel and calcium. It was found that under optimum conditions 98 \% of the copper was extracted, with only 0.9 \% of the nickel and 1.3 \% of the calcium being extracted. The subsequent copper stripping efficiency was 95.7 \%. In the second stage, the remaining aqueous solution was treated to remove nickel with minimum calcium removal. During this stage, the corresponding nickel and calcium removal percentages were 99.0 and 0.55 \%, respectively, with a nickel stripping efficiency of 84.1 \%. Laboratory bench-scale tests using a two-stage mixer-settler showed a good correlation with these results when moving to a semi-continuous process, which extracted 99.7 \% of the copper and 98.2 \% of the nickel, with only 2.2 \% calcium extraction.},

abstract = {This study explores the use of novel green emulation liquid membranes (GELMs) for the simultaneous extraction and stripping of Cd (II) from aqueous solutions. A solute is transported through the membrane due to the presence of the carrier and then concentrated in the internal phase. Soybean, sunflower, corn, and canola oils were used to form green substitutes to petroleum-based organic diluents for use as GELMs. Bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (D2EHPA), tri-butyl- phosphate (TBP), and trioctylamine (TOA) were the extractants, span 80 was the emulsifier, and HCl or H2SO4 was used as the stripping agent. The best conditions for maximum extraction efficiency (98.68%), stripping efficiency (97.14%), and lowest membrane breakage (0.9%) were achieved using a mixture of sunflower oil and kerosene in the ratio of 70:30. The other optimum values of the variables were: 2% (v/v) Span 80, 10 min emulsification time, 12700 rpm emulsification speed, 400 rpm of agitation speed, 5% (v/v) D2EHPA, an external phase pH was 3.5, an internal phase of 0.25 M HCl, and 5:1 of the treat ratio (external phase to emulsion) at 10 min contact time. The synthesized membrane was reused eight times, with approximately the same efficiency and no significant breakage during the first seven cycles.}
