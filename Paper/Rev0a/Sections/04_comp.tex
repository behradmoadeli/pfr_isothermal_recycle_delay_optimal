\section{Output Feedback Compensator}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Briefly discuss the performance of full-state feedback in control systems.
    \item Highlight the limitations and challenges associated with full-state feedback.
    \item Introduce the concepts of state reconstruction and compensator design.
    \item Present a block diagram illustrating the full-state regulation and compensator approach.
    \item Define the system output and the output matrix \( C \).
    \item Explore the criteria for choosing an appropriate observer.
    \item Describe the method used for calculating the observer gain \( L \) and justify the choice.
    \item Explain how the observer gain \( L \) is implemented in the control system.
\end{itemize}
