In many petrochemical, biochemical, and pharmaceutical unit operations, transport-reaction processes are described by distributed parameter system (DPS) models. These models are typically formulated using parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that capture the intrinsic features of reactions, convection, and diffusion within a finite spatial domain. Among these DPS models, axial dispersion tubular reactors tend to receive significant attention in industry due to not only their prevalence but the complexity of their practical realization. The modeling and control of tubular reactors are also important for ensuring safe and cost-effective operations across a wide range of industrial applications, making it an ongoing subject of extensive research. Numerous factors such as the recycling of the flow as well as considering various types of delays (e.g. input/output delays or state delays) can make model analysis and controller design more challenging when considering the practical realization of the distributed parameters system. Instabilities are also possible to arise in apparently stable reactor operations, making it crucial to carefully consider the effects of recycling process in the model. Modeling and control of similar realizations has been done, considering either instantanous recycle in a tubular reactor, or input/output delays for analogous distributed parameters systems.

In this work, an infinite dimensional transient parabolic representation is utilized to model the behaviour of a tubular reactor with recycle. However, as most of recycle representations in the real world are not instantanous, a notion of state delay has been introduced to address the fact that recycling a flow takes considerable amount of time. As previously mentioned, this will affect all aspects of the model, as well as the control structure. Therefore, a model-predictive control structure has also been proposed with the goal of ensuring stability as well as setpoint tracking within finite time horizon. Knowing that most modern control strategies focus on discrete time set
